was blown up. In the second failure, the train recovered from the malfunction. In this case, the train needed to 
move to the maintenance building.
Figure 6 shows a catastrophic drop on the air pressure near 23:00 due to a broken air pipe. This problem was 
classified as a severe malfunction, and the train needed to be removed from operation.
Failure 2 - Air leak on air dryer. The second failure is provoked by a malfunction of the pneumatic pilot valve 
that opens the drain pipes during the operation of the compressor. Figure 7 shows some anomalies on the regu
-
lar fill of air tanks and consumption by the train clients. Between 12:00 and 14:00, we can observe huge drops in 
air pressure, provoking an alarm for the train driver (LPS warning variable), the compressor tries to compensate 
for the lack of air pressure, and the train continues in operation. After 15:00, the APU behaviour stabilises due 
to the return of the normal pattern of the pneumatic pilot valve.

•	 TP34 - Pressure generated at the pneumatic panel (bar).
•	 H14 - Valve that is activated when the pressure read by the pressure switch of the command is above the oper-
ating pressure of 10.2 bar (bar).
•	 DV_pressure 4 - Pressure exerted due to pressure drop generated when air dryers towers discharge the 
water. When it is equal to zero, the compressor is working under load (bar).
•	 Reservoirs4 - Pressure inside the air tanks installed on the trains (bar).
•	 Oil_Temperature5 - Temperature of the oil present on the compressor (°C).
•	 Flowmeter6 - Airflow was measured on the pneumatic control panel (m3/h).
•	 Motor_Current 7 - Motor’s current, which should present the following values: (i) close to 0 A when the 
compressor turns off; (ii) close to 4 A when the compressor is working offloaded; and (iii) close to 7 A when 
the compressor is operating under load (A);
Digital sensors. The eight digital signals are collected directly from the APU and GPS information.

•	 COMP - Electrical signal of the air intake valve on the compressor. It is active when there is no admission of air 
on the compressor, meaning that the compressor turns off or working offloaded.
•	 DV_electric - Electrical signal that commands the compressor outlet valve. When it is active, it means 
that the compressor is working under load; when it is not active, it means that the compressor is off or 
offloaded.
•	 TOWERS - Signal that defines which tower is drying the air and which tower is draining the humidity removed 
from the air. When it is not active, it means that tower one is working; when it is active, it means that tower 
two is working.
•	 MPG - Is responsible for activating the intake valve to start the compressor under load when the pressure in

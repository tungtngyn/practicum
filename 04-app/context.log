In Fig. 4, we show the data collected from the GPS module, which includes latitude, longitude, speed and 
GPS signal quality, again for the same period reported in Fig. 2. The positional data is important to derive if the 
train is parked or in operation (cf. Table  1). The parking zones are typically located at the end of each line or 
in some underground parks. There are no missing values in this data. When the satellite information is lost by

the APU for the same period reported in Fig. 2, i.e. on a normal operating day (Jan 1, 2022) from 8:00 to 10:30.
In Fig. 4, we show the data collected from the GPS module, which includes latitude, longitude, speed and 
GPS signal quality, again for the same period reported in Fig. 2. The positional data is important to derive if the 
train is parked or in operation (cf. Table  1). The parking zones are typically located at the end of each line or 
in some underground parks. There are no missing values in this data. When the satellite information is lost by 
entering a tunnel (cf. Figure 5), it is set to 0.

Prompt: Can you show me what oil temperature looks like around the anomaly period?

for the lack of air pressure, and the train continues in operation. After 15:00, the APU behaviour stabilises due 
to the return of the normal pattern of the pneumatic pilot valve.
Failure 3 - Oil leak on compressor. Regarding the oil leak, due to hardware design, there was not any signal sys
-
tem related to oil to warn the train driver. The oil leak provoked severe damage to the engine of the compressor, 
and subsequently, due to the inoperable compressor, it was observed a drop on the air pressure and the train 
needed to be removed from the tracks.
Figure 8 shows irregular patterns since 12:00 on the oil temperature, indicating that there is some issue with 
the oil system, we can also observe strange patterns on the air system, signalling that maybe the oil is escaping to 
the air system or the compressor is losing their efficiency.

Prompt: Can you remind me what unit oil temperature is in?

Retrieved: 4, Sample (Top-1):
•	 TP34 - Pressure generated at the pneumatic panel (bar).
•	 H14 - Valve that is activated when the pressure read by the pressure switch of the command is above the oper-
ating pressure of 10.2 bar (bar).
•	 DV_pressure 4 - Pressure exerted due to pressure drop generated when air dryers towers discharge the 
water. When it is equal to zero, the compressor is working under load (bar).
•	 Reservoirs4 - Pressure inside the air tanks installed on the trains (bar).
•	 Oil_Temperature5 - Temperature of the oil present on the compressor (°C).
•	 Flowmeter6 - Airflow was measured on the pneumatic control panel (m3/h).
•	 Motor_Current 7 - Motor’s current, which should present the following values: (i) close to 0 A when the 
compressor turns off; (ii) close to 4 A when the compressor is working offloaded; and (iii) close to 7 A when 
the compressor is operating under load (A);
Digital sensors. The eight digital signals are collected directly from the APU and GPS information.
